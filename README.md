Digital Clock Next
==================

This is "next" version of my [Digital Clock 4](https://github.com/Kolcha/DigitalClock4). It has completely new written from scratch skin engine (but old skins are supported) which adds many new features and possibilities giving even more flexibility in customization.

How to build
------------

For now the only external dependency is Qt. At least Qt 6.4 is required, Qt 6.5 is recommended, anything newer is not tested yet.

Some recently implemented C++20 features are used in the source code, so pretty new compiler is required:

* Windows: Visual Studio 2019 (at least version 16.10 with compiler version 19.29)
* macOS: Xcode 14.3.1 (with Apple clang 14.0.3), Xcode 15 is recommended
* Linux: GCC 10 (10.5.0 is known to work), GCC 11 or above is recommended
